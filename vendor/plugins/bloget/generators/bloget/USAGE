Description:
  This generator installs Bloget inside your Rails application.
  
  It will copy models, controllers, views, and migrations for Bloget
  into your application. The internals of the models and controllers
  remain in this plugin, but the files are copied so you may extend them.

Example:
  ./script/generate bloget
